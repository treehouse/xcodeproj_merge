# xcodeproj_merge

Copies file references from one Xcode project to another.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xcodeproj_merge'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xcodeproj_merge

## Usage

    $ xcodeproj_merge source.xcodeproj destination.xcodeproj

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec xcodeproj_merge` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
